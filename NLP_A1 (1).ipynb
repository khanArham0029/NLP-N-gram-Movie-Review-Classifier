            "Review: cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired with a script that the screenwriters for touched by an angel might have passed up as being too impuissant ozpetek still keeps us interested at times in fact i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate onesbr br this movie is at heart pun intended a story built on a big twiststyle ending this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatores una pura formalità or godawful garbage like the films of m night shyamalan cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter i found the cinematography in general to be above average the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mothers house for me the grotesque parody of michelangelos pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpeteks method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno in fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of its main character it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad br br in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporatedriven societies by urging us to be more spiritual not necessarily religious and more altruistic and while im certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object could the characters have been anymore twodimensional i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless was the evil aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature it goes for the people on the side of right too like the good aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio and just in case we might have missed ozpeteks point he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries br br this brings me to an interesting point about the directors use of color he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as irene when we first meet her and after her lifeconversion the evil aunt eleonora and of course the good but confused padre carras black is a color that suggests a definite course the wearers mind is set and emotionless it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor the business suit it is also the color of mourning such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo finally black is the color of piety such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film br br the other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component the character who wears red is bold emotional receptive to new ideas and indulgent red is a risky color in modern times it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism as the earliest members of cromagnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah adam is named after the hebrew word for red red also has an anachronistic flavor looking back on the past where red and by association a less selfdriven attitude towards life was more accepted so when we encounter the redfilled room the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish of irenes mother good characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red and finally the painting of irenes mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpeteks sympathies liebr br a word or two about the soundtrack i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story the quasibaroque theme that signified irene was great for its monotony and feeling of restive malaise the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubricks barry lyndon with its masterful repetitions of an 8bar sarabande attributed to handel one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house it is of the famous aria ebben ne andrò lontano from catalanis opera la wally the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever as irenes mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive i just have one minor question of the soundtrack why include the famous tango yo soy maria i love the song and personally could hear it all the time but it didnt really fit here\n",

rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of viewbr br directed by william cameron menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by hg wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriterbr br the film opens in 1940 in a londonlike everytown war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally were taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moonbr br that might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments theres a constant parade of new faces we dont get to learn anything about any of thembr br it doesnt help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionallybr br in fact one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score i cant say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of dramabr br but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesnt make it work _as a film_ that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented herebr br the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations thats a fine thing to make a film about its also remarkably prescient of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesnt preclude progressin fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectlybr br that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field they cant both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two functioning gasmasks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says hes dying anyway what to do its not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideasthe bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a warare enough to build a film onbr br another example during the scenes featuring the wouldbe warlord in the postapocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought its a great idea and deserved its own filmbr br similarly wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas that was enough for its own film too its just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when its supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attractionbr br still there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if youre at all a scifi buff this is a historically important film given menzies background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated its also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george méliès 1902 a trip to the moon aka le voyage dans la lune just dont expect too much from things to come\n",

            "Review: well it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film but somehow multiple different genres and a clichéd plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films ive seen in ages the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a road trip style teenage comedy and a texas chainsaw massacre style redneck horror vibe and while one gets in the way of the other quite often director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that were never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next things start out worryingly as were introduced to two characters both irritating in different ways adam is a wussy virgin while harley is a fat bigmouthed ahole theyre both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school after a couple of strange events they pick up a hitchhiker and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknownbr br the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the films biggest assets the truck itself looks spooky because its so haggard and rusty and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful after a while you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray things start to look up the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitchhiker are interesting enough just when you think the film couldnt possibly get any messier things take a turn for the weird in the final third without spoiling things it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldnt possibly be seen coming and along with the twist is a big surprise some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits overall this isnt a great film by any means but if youre looking for some silly entertainment monster man should hit the spot\n",

            "Review: i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90s cant hold a candle to 70s and 80s horror films i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them dont know what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the fridays so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that dont rely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no moviebr br john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you dont need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they dont no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not the same you cant be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall its the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just dont know where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavorbr br in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life silently locked up in an institute as loomis his doctor says to sheriff brackett i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure evil that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no one know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well br br what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesnt she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are fogged up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesnt but its astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond br br halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcocks steps maybe directors should follow in hisbr br halloween personifies everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that dont know the difference between evil and cuteness then halloween is a film that should be seen it wont let you down i enjoy being scared i dont know why but i do but nothing has scared me in the 90s except maybe one film wes cravens final nightmare if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not wanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watchbr br and just to follow up after seeing zombies version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie bastardized his version but it doesnt take away from the brilliance of this one\n",

            "Review: happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974 but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cashin on the success of american graffittibr br there were some similarities between american graffitti and happy daysbr br both opened with rock around the clock by bill haley the comets both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles but there were also some major differences while american graffitti took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood happy days took place in milwaulkee wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescencebr br happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley the comets rock around the clock but when oldies became hot thanks to the success of american graffitti and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974 royalty payments went through the roof so a remake of the song the correct term is now new stereo recording was quickly substitutedbr br the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me rightbr br fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist liberties were taken and details overlooked making this show less than completely authenticbr br this is perfectly fine happy days is supposed to be a comedy not a history lesson but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life the issue of the draft even came up on a later episodebr br the show as originally set in 1955 one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast most of them were teenagers and as each year passed it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s that along with the writers running out of ideas and later cast members like ron howard leaving the series wisely quitting while they were ahead left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead that along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldnt control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene began to wear very thin very fastbr br this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era time heals wounds you know everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the original hit versions over those new stereo recordings those new stereo recordings worked very well on happy days and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd unlike the complete first season dvd the original music on the complete second season has been replaced with different music while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch\n",

            "Review: if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you youve chosen the wrong filmbr br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things dont happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything were not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life were talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed were talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybodybr br i am from that small island and ive heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up thats how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his mates dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too tb was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms after the war there were times of hardshipbr br so you wont find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody youll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they dontbr br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan that was remarkable\n",

the name of tradition never to coincide art imitates life or so the claim goes and popular hindi cinema is no exception reflecting an underlying misogyny which regrettably forms the foundation of much of the collective indian culture but why what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors including rape murder infanticide imposed illiteracy infidelity and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of dowry rajkumar santoshis latest offering lajja asks the same plaintive question linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chaptersepisodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist vaidehi manisha koiralabr br direction on santoshis part is not up to par with the level the story demands he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side instead of headon santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival but rather for the masses of his country regrettably the tackiness shows and the film too often delves into the actionbloodgore genre that santoshi specializes in the film suffers from its jerky episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrivedbr br the female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts the protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful manisha koirala who proves in lajja that she is one of our times more competent leading ladies and given a proper role and set up emerges with a truly commendable performance one wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand mahima choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent cast as janki madhuri dixit performs with a neverbeforeseen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of acting the role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of songndance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this wouldbe feminist saga that of the ceaselessly talented rekha lajja is manisha koiralas film there can be no doubt about that but it is rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart rekha dazzles as ramdulari foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film comparisons are indeed odious especially when rendered opposite one of the worlds great leading ladies but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadowbr br lajja has none of the sophistication of protofeminist dramas like zubeidaa pinjar or even the hellqueen celebration laadla it fulfills its feministic goals in two early momentsthe loud tirade in which mahima berates her inlaws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl she erupts leaving the wedding procession in shambles seeing her father devastated she begins to weep blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her she bemoans why did i say anything i have ruined everything it is all my fault her grandmother witnessing silently the abuse she bore comforts her by saying why are you crying there is no reason for you to be crying you are not at fault for anything the fault is mine the fault is of every woman who came before you because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today there would have been no need for you to say anything today in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid plainly in sight through wordsbr br the other more subtle moment comes very early in the film when vaidehi manisha has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents home in india to viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed natural that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents this however is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures india among them once a woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets family business children etc for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as damaged goods one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor her father rebukes her for her actions concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of vaidehis younger sister a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs however violent and sadistic he may be he levies against her the age old adage that the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter quietly and pensively she

            "Review: east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william windom is the boy its a progressive film for china i guess but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he cruises the park without fearhe hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to squat for a period of time handcuffed slapped this is what the gay man wants and implicitly the gay man is challenging the cops selfimage as a manly man the storys about the gay mans life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for chinas gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i cant relate\n",

gibson mad max lethal weapon and prethe passion of the christ notoriety in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier and rightly so see my review on his hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the bards timeless and most quoted tragedies and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a fullbloodied treatment explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time combined with a dream cast and a lot of little additions which were wellchosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare kenneth branagh the director of henry v and dead again joining the lethal weapon star are glenn close the big chill paul scofield a man for all seasons alan bates ian holm michael maloney who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parkers othello see my review of oliviers stage version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3hour version of hamlet a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well 5 years later nathaniel parker who would be cast as cassio in his brothers version of othello 4 years later and helena bonhamcarter who would be cast in mary shelleys frankenstein 4 years later br br zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier who had died 2 years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirellis misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of hamlets lines to the ghost also helena bonhamcarter did not convince me as ophelia she was too dull and unreal whereas jean simmons who had immortalized the role in oliviers version and kate winslet who did an acceptable job in kenneth branaghs uncut epic revisionist reworking of hamlet were good in the role with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever thats why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 she didnt winwhat a shame ian holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as i expected him to in a scene with him laertes and ophelia but then again im more used to felix aylmer and richard briers interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of hamlet both done by great directors actors texteditors producers and stars of all their versions of the bards work as polonius br br the rest of the cast however was excellent the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required br br i recommend this version just to pass the time but its ideal as a teaching tool for 12thgrade english teachers i recommend showing oliviers version first then branaghs and finally this version despite the films pg rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie only what the play called for br br the best versions of hamlet are br br 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh both were so good that i cant decide which one was the best see my reviews on these versions for more information br br 2 franco zeffirelli this one was alright it started out alright with a scene not in the play but shouldve then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out whos there nay answer me stand and unfold yourself that scene scares the hell out of you because youre sitting quietly and thenbam you almost jump out of your skin in short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play huge blunder on zeffirellis part to omit that scene it also misplaced a lot of lines and cut others that i think shouldve been put in such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene not where it was placed in the film after the to be or not to be soliloquy this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier as several of the actors aside from him had performed hamlet on stageor on film many times on different occasions however zeffirellis take on hamlet is faithful to the play and thats what i was looking for the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branaghs versions only that the denouement in branaghs version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions more in line with the play olivier toned it downand it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his ownto very good effect br br this version is not rated\n",

            "Review: aslan adam or lionman as its more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with an epic battle as king solomon his army defeats a load of guys although im not sure who they were the film itself isnt too helpful in establishing the fact anyway after king solomon has slaughtered all these guys princess maria bishop osorio commander antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets king solomon rule just about everything in sight soon after princess maria seduces solomon they have sex meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever just two sentences long antoine weds princess maria is planning to rebel against solomon gain some sweet revenge in the process antoine his guards attack kill solomon even though his pregnant wife princess almunia escapes with her protector rostin with antoines guards in hot pursuit after the shortest labour ever less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush princess almunia gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from antoines guards unfortunately when rostin tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of lions as one of their own years later the evil antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy princess maria has given birth he has a son but rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow antoine the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary lionman who is more beast than manbr br this turkish greek coproduction was directed by natuk baytan as natuch baitan is a one of a kind type of film i found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining the script never seems to take itself seriously it is a pretty funny film at times it moves along like a rocket is never dull or boring some of the english dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with whats happening on screen none of it makes any sense we get a boy raised by lions an evil king betrayal dark family secrets birthmarks that form the shape of lions in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by lions crazy fight scenes torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires gymnastic rings idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair a central character who has a jaw line resembling a housebrick can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid this acid can eat its way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug fall over 20 feet onto a concrete floor yet maintain no serious injury aslan adam is a terrifically entertaining film i dont think ive seen another film quite like it that i can compare it too if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like sobadtheyregood type films want to have fun laugh be entertained then aslan adam should be at the very top of your list total 100 gold for bad film fans those with a taste for the different bizarre on the disappointing side lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end which is a shamebr br director bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although its far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background there is one point where lionman uses a branch to pole vault but its obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it then theres the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever there are just so many individual scenes in aslan adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that i could go on forever just check the ending out when lionman is jumping flying about everywhere like he can fly theres lots of blood in aslan adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few stabbings someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it getsbr br technically aslan adam is pretty ropey the period costumes are bright garish featuring purples yellows reds various other bright colours the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film is yet another bizarre aspect to aslan adam the acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was badbr br aslan adam is pure gold from start to finish there are so many things to like laugh at enjoy in this film that i just ended up really liking it in no way whatsoever can aslan adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but its one hell of an entertaining one i may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that i didnt dream it all the best turkish action film about a man raised by lions you will ever see period proved popular enough to spawn a sequel lionman ii the witchqueen 1979\n",

            "Review: let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 999 of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately if you dont believe me see darkness falls or they and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab bleed the pool and so on one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film director david schmoeller talks about this problem on the dvds commentary track there are exceptions though like poltergeist which had also received a pg rating however there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like poltergeist nor was it produced by steven spielberg that alone was enough to guarantee poltergeist success still for those of you that have seen tourist trap you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg the heart burst scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of poltergeist in the video store shelf picked it up saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead years later i finally saw poltergeist and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film from then on i would never judge a film based on its rating again this is most likely what happened to tourist trap people like me with poltergeist will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film most likely it would be a teenager too which most of these types of films are targeted at friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time it found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels when you look at it folks tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th the same thing couldve happened to tourist trap we could have seen tourist trap 2 3 4 and so on as far as the film goes tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget but it is well acted well directed and well made on many levels chuck connors is a riot as mr slausen and gives the best performance in the film special credit must be give to composer pino donaggio whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness the music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy donaggio worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of daveys powers maybe that is how its supposed to be he just has them and we should accept that in order for the movie to work we do accept it to a point but then the screenplay has incidents like how davey makes the phone ring in the store while hes in the basement of the house in that case is davey limited in using his powers can he make a phone ring in houston detroit los angeles what is his range those are things that people that didnt care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws others would accept it as a mistake i accept it there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it this is a horror film we should not be required to read too much into it many people have called this the killer mannequin movie i assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film the mannequins are controlled by the power of davey who uses them as a weapon this is a common misconception about this film some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film overall tourist trap is a good fun rentalout of 5\n",

butler and the house boy are especially irritating they are onedimensional stock villain characters the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dancebr br astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner ginger rogers joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film and is miscast in a musical she has little going for her characterwise other than her lovely face and beautiful smilebr br george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride as jerrys publicist and his ditzy secretary the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot and gracie has some funny lines but she is also very annoying at timesbr br the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done at times the cinematography is horrible and offfocus there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets to try to convince the audience that we are in london not hollywood they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie on the plus side the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific and have become classic song standards and of course the dancing in the movie is exceptional thanks to astaire and his choreographer hermes panbr br but the musical and dance numbers are illused and illstaged at times the cast seems to start singing and dancing because well its time for them to start singing and dancing the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot at one point the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason the numbers include im dancing and i cant be bothered now fred dances well on a foggy trafficfilled london street he does some great canetwirling with a rolled umbrella but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing doubledecker bus in the broadway musical crazy for you harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girlsbr br put me to the test fred george and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage george and gracie match fred step for step but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reasonbr br stiff upper lip the fun house number at an amusement park fun house fred george and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor rotating barrel and with the fun house mirrors its the best number of the movie but it gets a little repetitious at timesbr br things are looking up fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate fortunately its a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancerbr br a foggy day in london town fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london at times he looks as if hes not sure which way hes going in the fog much like the musical number itselfbr br nice work if you can get it a great song that is misused in the movie during a social event at the manor house fred gets drawn into a chorus of dourfaced singers who are haphazardly singing this song each time fred joins in the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave again harry groener did a better dance number with this song in crazy for you drum dance number as fred and joan are eloping fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums as usual its a great dance number but theres absolutely no need for it except to prolong the moviebr br the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine as he leaps from the balcony he finds a convenientlyplaced trapeze thats right a trapeze hanging from a nearby tree fred or rather a stuntman in freds clothes grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from itbr br the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote the ff button allows you to skip through the other boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers\n",

week beats your year fellow which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder furthermore just as byrons poetry is inseparable from his life the mans life itself must be seen as a whole lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture its showing a different picture altogetherbr br now in short my review comes down to this supposedly byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime true he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in but in the end this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life wed all want to lead no well i did not at any moment want to live the life depicted in this film so it gets 3 not for being so badly done which directionwise it more or less was but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plotbr br some more detail well to over simplify things a byron bio should have two distinct episodes 1 postfirst europe trip england and his rise to fame marriage 2 his life abroad now the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first not only was it a lot longer but the most significant change in byron took place then furthermore its where he created his best works don juan the vision of judgement etc all the stuff that makes him really unique in english literaturebr br instead in this film a byrons life never comes across as even remotely entertaining b it only gets worse after he leaves england they did two good jobs first they started at his return of his europe trip though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue second they chose an angle and they chose his incestuous love for augusta who is rather perfectly cast the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go true byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life but especially as he was such a mood swing person the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed lifebr br anyway the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england theres no doubt about that the thing is once abroad a life of debauchery began with the infamous geneva period but in italy byron also discovered a new life both for his poetry inspired by italian comedy already in venice and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna afterwards at the request of shelly with teresa to pisa in other words he was also liberated his mind and life opened up and not only in the decadent sense while englands closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age true freedom was augustaless but this bittersweet freedom tastes sour in this film we see a lonely bored snob getting olderbr br i mean hell byron never thought much about his poetry except when he finally found his own voice in don juan apart from poetic and romantic developments his relationship with shelly and the downbreak should have been more documented also it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas this is important as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more plantedinlife realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan life and work are one true still a bit naive but its what got him to greece and the whole thing came full circle in pisa where shelleys revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark missolonghi wasnt the bored snob suddenly looking for some action it was the insights in italy the gambas stirring him into action it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancientstyle battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism but it wasnt just that there was a true inspiration behind it meanwhile byron wrote massive amounts of don juan true his end is a bit sad but its not like hes worn out that is the essence of byrons life he may have had some strong emotional attachments 2 augusta and teresa but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly meaning that he wasnt less at the end of his life no hed made a physical and mental journey that at the time few people were prepared to makebr br i wonder why is it that so often the second period in byrons life is overlooked because it had less obvious conflicts as the man was finally coming to his own in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time which byron so despised and which despite the fact that he had no choice he willingly fled in 1816 to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a selfobsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause\n",

            "Review: robert colomb has two fulltime jobs hes known throughout the world as a globetrotting tv reporter less wellknown but equally effortful are his exploits as a fulltime philandererbr br i saw vivre pour vivre dubbed in english with the title live for life some life robert seems to always have at least three women in his life one mistress on her way out one on her way in and the cheated wife at home it helps that robert is a glib liar among his most useful lies are ill call you tomorrow and my work took longer than planned he spends a lot of time and money on planes trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons you wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants downbr br some may find his life exciting but i thought it to be tedious his companions including his wife catherine are all attractive and desirable women but his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful you wonder if hes enjoying all thisbr br adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesnt further the plot there are extended sections with no dialogue or frenchonly dialogue we see documentaries of wars torture and troop training interspersed with the live action when roberts flight returns from africa we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminalbr br annie girardot is the standout performer in this film hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection it was also nice to see candice bergen at the beginning of her career i cant find fault with yves montands performance of what was basically an amoral bumbr br i enjoyed some of claude lelouchs novel techniques in a hotel room scene the camera pans around the room as robert and his mistress argue we catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room in another scene set on a sleeping car of a train robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train i sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news i also liked the exciting safari scenes in africa the cinematography of those scenes and of those in amsterdam was superbbr br i reviewed this movie as part of a project at the library of congress ive named the project fifty 50 notable films forgotten within 50 years as best i can determine this film like the other fortynine ive identified has not been on video telecast or distributed in the us since its original release in my opinion it is worthy of being made available againbr br\n",
