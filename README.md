# NLP-N-gram-Movie-Review-Classifier
This repository contains the code for my NLP assignment, where I built N-gram models from scratch and used them to classify movie reviews. The project includes the implementation of unigram, bigram, and trigram models for word prediction and Bayesian classification of movie reviews.
